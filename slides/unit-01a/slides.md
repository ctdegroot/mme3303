## What is a Fluid?

- What is the difference between a fluid and a solid?

> - Solids have a fixed shape; fluids take the shape of their container.
> - Fluids deform continuously under the applicaiton of a shear stress.
> - Both liquids and gases are fluids.

## What is Fluid Mechanics?

> **Fluid Mechanics** deals with the behavior of fluids (liquids and gases) in response to forces.

- When a fluid is at rest we are dealing with *fluid statics* or *hydrostatics*
- When a fluid is in motion we are dealing with *fluid dynamics*.

<!-- .slide: class="instructor-only" -->
## Differential Analysis

> - Draw a pump and label flow in/out, work in
> - Label this pump **integral analysis**
> - Next, draw the outline of the pump and draw some velocity vectors
> - Label this **differential analysis**

## Dimensional Analysis

![Moody Diagram.](img/Moody_EN.svg)

$$ \Delta p = f_D \frac{\rho V^2}{2}\frac{L}{D} $$

--
## Similarity and Scaling

- Part of dimensional analysis
- Allows us to relate model-scale and full-scale flows
